[![Playwright Tests](https://github.com/danprime/bookooscale/actions/workflows/playwright.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danprime/bookooscale/actions/workflows/playwright.yml)

This repository contains the BOOKOO Mini Scale Reader web UI and Playwright tests. The Playwright CI runs only on Chromium because BLE functionality and the Bluetooth Web API work reliably only on Chromium-based browsers.
